Next, click on the file icon in the upper left corner of the text editor. You’ll see the different HTML files that the server is ready to send to the browser whenever those links are clicked. These HTML files correspond to the different web pages that are displayed in the browser. When the Dogs link is clicked, the server will send the dogs.html file to the client.
